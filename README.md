Toki Pona is a simple language with limited vocabuary, only 140 words. But it's more than that. It's a philosphy.

By using so few words, you have to break down big concepts into simple things.

For example:
* Geologist -> Person of earth knowledge
* "I am hungry" -> want eat
* "to teach" -> give knowledge

What is a "bad friend"? In Toki Pona, the word for "friend" is "a good person". Therefore "bad friend" is a contradiction, because they cannot be a good person.
